# HeadFirstJSProgramming
Personal repository for playing with the puzzles in the book. Headfirst JS programming.

Finished reading this book, it was a wonderful experience. Even though it taught elementary concepts. It did those with perfection.
Many people who feel they are good at JS, will feel left behind after reading this book.

PS : Best closure concept material I have read till now.

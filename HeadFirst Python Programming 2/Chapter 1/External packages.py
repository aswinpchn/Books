# We know from Chapter 1 that Pythonâ€™s standard library comes with lots of batteries
# included. However, there are times when we need to use an application-specific third-party
# module, which is not part of the standard library. Third-party modules are
# imported into your Python program as needed. However, unlike the standard library
# modules, third-party modules need to be installed before they are imported and used.
# Flask is one such third-party module.
# As mentioned in the previous chapter, the Python community maintains a centrally
# managed website for third-party modules called PyPI (short for the Python Package
# Index), which hosts the latest version of Flask (as well as many other projects).

# python3 -m pip install flask       Here is a command to install flask (Meaning adding flask to site-packages).

# Pycharm -> Preferences -> Python interpreter -> Here we can add new packages / upgrade current packages.

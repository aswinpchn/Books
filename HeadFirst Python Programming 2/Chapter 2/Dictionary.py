# Dictionary: an unordered set of key/value pairs
# Depending on your programming background, you may already know what a
# dictionary is, but you may know it by another name, such as associative array,
# map, symbol table, or hash.

# Like those other data structures in those other languages, Python’s dictionary
# allows you to store a collection of key/value pairs. Each unique key has a value
# associated with it in the dictionary, and dictionaries can have any number of
# pairs. The values associated with a key can be any object.

# Dictionaries are unordered and mutable. It can be useful to think of Python’s
# dictionary as a two-columned, multirow data structure. Like lists, dictionaries
# can grow (and shrink) on demand.

If the line is a straight line, then it will have the y = mx + c formula.

Cost Function:
  We have to select a line based on given inputs. If we are selecting the line, m and c can differ based on person to person who chooses it.

  In this case, we should select m and c, such that the deviation is minimal.

  We use the Cost function / Squared error function to find the value of m and c, such that the error(deviation) is minimal.

  We can measure the accuracy of our hypothesis function by using a cost function. This takes an average difference (actually a fancier version of an average) of all the results of the hypothesis with inputs from x's and the actual output y's.

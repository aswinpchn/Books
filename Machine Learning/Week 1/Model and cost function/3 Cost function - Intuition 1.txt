This video is a follow up of the cost function we saw in the last video.

Remember the equation we saw last video, y = mx + c, to simplyfying the understanding the squared error function, we keep c as zero. So we only have y = mx.

  See image 5

Now we are experimenting the squared error function we have.
  
  We have 3 data points (1, 1), (2, 2), and (3, 3)
  First, y = mx + c
  Then, y = mx (We decide to keep c as zero for simplication)
  
  Case 1:
    We experiment with m as 1.
    The squared error function will gives us 0. This means that there is no error in our prediction. No deviation from the actual data points. (Image 6)

  Case 2:
    We experiment with m as 0.5.
    The squared error function will gives us 0.58 (Image 7)

  Case 3:
    We experiment with m as 0.
    The squared error function will gives us 2.3. We see that error keeps expanding.  (Image 8)

  For the three cases, we understand that m as 1 is the best possible prediction for this data set. As that is giving us the least possible error in the squared error function.

  Final analysis: 
    If we see the pattern, it come to a sort of 1D hyperbola.
